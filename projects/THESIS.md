Abstract: From the perspective of communication science, the communication of architectural images in the new media age
has an obvious beautifying trend. Due to the differences in politics, economics, and cultural environment between China and 
western countries, the beautification of architectural images in China is a unique phenomenon. This study classifies the 
beautification of Chinese architectural images into different types in terms of image communication: audience orientation, 
time orientation, space orientation, and cultural orientation. By investigating and analyzing relevant cases, this study explores 
the beautification of Chinese architectural images in the new media age and puts forward thoughts and evaluation, aiming to 
better comprehend the relationship between beautification and architectural communication.
