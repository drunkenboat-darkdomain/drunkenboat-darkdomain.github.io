# This is Tara Liu

BFU urban planning '23

Fun facts about me:

A metalhead who [deeply likes the last.fm's listening report](https://www.last.fm/user/Pagan_Flame_/listening-report)

A paperback book advocate who suffers in moving every time, but they feel different and old school!

A gym woman happens to like cooking.

Prefer text and data to graph so much that track daily outfits by feature keywords in a PostgreSQL database.

I think [Giant anteater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_anteater) and [Tamandua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamandua) are cute!!!!
