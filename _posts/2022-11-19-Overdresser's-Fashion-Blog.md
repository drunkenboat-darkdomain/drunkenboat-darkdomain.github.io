title: "Overdresser's Fashion Blog 001 - Treat It Seriously"
---

Yes, I start a fashion blog in 2022 after watching [bestdressed](https://www.youtube.com/@bestdressed)'s videos an unhealthy amount of times. And the most inspiring thing I learned from her is that outfit style is not something one is born with but from efforts, trials and errors, and reflection.

I want to treat my outfits seriously because they can manifest my personality and attitude, so here are what I did:

1. track daily outfits on my paperback diary
2. input them into a PostgreSQL database 
3. review and conclude

After one month, I found some patterns in my outfit features that I had overlooked in the past:

- Mainly like vintage and dark colors, like dark green, vintage red, black and brown.
- Emphasize comfort. I will choose Converse more often than heels.
- Prefer midi skirt to short skirt, especially in bodycon silhouette.

In addition to my known features:
- More mature look
- Defined waistline
- Try-hard and overdressed over underdressed
