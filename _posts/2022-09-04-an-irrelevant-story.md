title: "AN IRRELEVANT STORY"

*I can’t retell what happened recently, but here‘s a random and totally irrelevant story, powered by my forsaken writing skill in GRE preparation.*

…So there’s an old shore resident, being cursed to stay in a wooden house with a collapsing roof. He heard that the turbulent tide wound devour that shore mercilessly despite the terrible signal, but he had nowhere to hide this doom.

Shadows engulfing the shore, he dug deep into the sands and was blessed to find some remains to disgracefully fix the roof. “Staying on the roof will be the safest way to survive”, he encouraged himself.

Midnight, wind lingering uncannily, the all-mighty tide destroyed the beloved wooden house that he decorated for years. His candle that brought tender light every shivering cold night drifted away, the fire of which finally died.

He was taken by the tide hundreds of miles away, with only a pathetic amount of fortune left. Having walked back to the shore for days, he rebuild the wooden house with aged branches on the way home.

And even if the tide would come and bring chaos again, he design the new wooden house with sincere craft. With green and pink minerals, shiny crystals made from tears, cactus of solitude, his wooden house will thrive until the day he can roam to the forest or land of ice and death.

Although he runs out of fire, the golden light of wisdom offers him warmth, and hugging the quilt made by juniper leaves, the old man dreams about the endless highway guiding him to where no tide dwells.
